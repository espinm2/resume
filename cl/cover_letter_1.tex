\opening{Dear Recruitment Officer,} 

% Where I learned about this place
I attended  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Career Fair and met with an employee representing Datto. I was motivated by Datto's use of technology to back up client's data and allow virtual instances of saved machines to run remotely. I'm excited about your company and Iâ€™ve attached my resume, which contains more detail of my past projects and experience.

% Mini Purpose
Despite coming from a research heavy background, I have worked on web based applications before. 
I've implemented a web front end as part of my research project to gather 3D models of architectural spaces. 
In addition because the computational complexity of simulations we provide users, I implemented the back end of our site to interface with our research code. Allowing users to get models generated from efficient c++ implementations. I used WebGL to display this information in 3D. Moreover I used  PostgreSQL to save research relevant data gathered from users. 
Overall I think the skill set I have acquired from this project, which you can view through my web page, would be compatible with your summer internship program.

%Closing statement
You can reach me at (203) 464-6533 or through email at espinm2@rpi.edu. Thank you for taking time to consider my credentials for this summer internship position.


Sincerely yours,
